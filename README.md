# TargetAllelePhasing
Pipeline for generating phased allele sequences from target capture data after processing with HybPiper.
Based on the workflow detailed here (https://github.com/mossmatters/phyloscripts/tree/master/alleles_workflow), but updated to use newer software versions which break the original workflow, and with re-formatted scripts to make it easier to run on any given batch of data.
